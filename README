The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

sigrok-test is a collection of various tools and files for testing sigrok.


Status
------

Work in progress.

Distro packagers should NOT package this!


Requirements
------------

 - git
 - gcc
 - make
 - autoconf >= 2.63
 - automake >= 1.11
 - pkg-config >= 0.22
 - libglib >= 2.24.0
 - Python >= 3.2
 - libsigrok >= 0.3.0
 - libsigrokdecode >= 0.3.0
 - python3-coverage


Building and usage
------------------

Assumption: libsigrok and libsigrokdecode are installed in $HOME/sr.
If they are in a standard location instead, you don't need the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH below.

In order to get the sigrok-test source code and build it, run:

 $ git clone git://sigrok.org/sigrok-test
 $ cd sigrok-test
 $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/sr/lib/pkgconfig ./configure \
	--with-decodersdir=/path/to/decoders
 $ make

This will test the decoders located at /path/to/decoders:

 $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/sr/lib ./decoder/test/pdtest -r -v -a
