The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

sigrok-test is a collection of various tools and files for testing sigrok.


Status
------

Work in progress.

Distro packagers should NOT package this!


Requirements
------------

 - git
 - gcc
 - make
 - autoconf >= 2.63
 - automake >= 1.11
 - pkg-config >= 0.22
 - libglib >= 2.24.0
 - Python >= 3.2
 - libsigrok >= 0.5.0
 - libsigrokdecode >= 0.5.0
 - python3-coverage


Building and usage
------------------

Assumption: libsigrok and libsigrokdecode are installed in $HOME/sr.
If they are in a standard location instead, you don't need the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH below.

In order to get the sigrok-test source code and build it, run:

 $ git clone git://sigrok.org/sigrok-test
 $ cd sigrok-test
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/sr/lib/pkgconfig ./configure \
	--with-decodersdir=/path/to/decoders
 $ make

This will test the decoders located at /path/to/decoders:

 $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/sr/lib ./decoder/pdtest -r -v -a


Adding tests
------------------

Of course the best way to add tests is to copy one that is similar, and adjust accordingly. Some notes:

* In test.conf, the channel assignments must be done in a specific way :
	protocol-decoder <pdname> channel <pd_channel_name>=<#> ...
	e.g.
	protocol-decoder mcs48 d0=8 d1=9 [...] a8=0 ...
Of important note, the channels/probes are numbered from 0, regardless of the naming used in the capture file.

* To troubleshoot a specific test, try
	./decoder/pdtest -v -d -r <test_root>
		to run all tests under decoder/test/<test_root>, or
	./decoder/pdtest -v -d -r <test_root>/<testname>
		to run the named test. Note, in this case <testname> is not a file but rather a test described
		in <test_root>/test.conf.

	./decoder/pdtest -v -s <test_root>
	will print the parameters as parsed from <test_root>/test.conf (useful to spot typos)
